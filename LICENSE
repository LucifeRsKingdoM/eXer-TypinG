### How It Works

1. **Welcome Screen:**  
   The user enters their name before proceeding.

2. **Configuration:**  
   The user selects the test type (words or paragraphs), duration (1, 3, 5, 10, 15 minutes or unlimited), and difficulty level. Upon starting the test, a random text is generated accordingly.

3. **Typing Test:**  
   The text is displayed word-by-word. As the user types, each character is validated in real time. Correct characters are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones turn red. The app only allows backspacing within the current word—once the space is pressed to finalize the word, corrections for that word are disabled.

4. **Results:**  
   When time runs out (or when the test is ended), the application calculates and displays the user’s WPM, accuracy, and other details. The results are temporarily saved in local storage.

5. **About Page:**  
   Provides an overview of the app’s features, the technologies used, and details about the developer.

This complete solution should meet your requirements for a beautiful, modern, and fully functional typing practice/test app. Enjoy coding and happy typing!
